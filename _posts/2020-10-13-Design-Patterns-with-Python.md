# Design Patterns with Python

### What are Design Patterns ?
A design pattern is *model solution* to a common design problem. It describe the problem and a general approch to solving it. 

### Why Design Patterns required ?
We need design patterns to ensure that our work is consistant, reliable and understandable.

### SOLID principles of Object Oriented Design
 
- S - Single responsibility principle. This means that a class should have only one responsibility, so either cooking or washing up, but not both.
- O - Open/closed principle. A class should be open for extension, usually by inheritance, but closed for modification.
- L - Liskov substitution principle, named after Barbara Liskov. It tells us that subclasses should be able to stand in for their parents in a program without breaking anything. 
- I - Interface segregation principle tells that many specific interfaces are better than one do-it-all interface. In Python, we use abstract base classes combined with multiple inheritance to achieve this effect. 
- D - Dependency inversion says that we should program towards abstractions, not implementations. Implementations can vary, abstractions should not. 

### Types of Design Patterns  ?

- Creational - Object creation
- Structural - Object relationships
- Behavioral - Object interaction and responsibility 

## The Strategy Pattern

- Classification : Behavioral design pattern. 
- Use : To control the operation of some object.
- Also know as Policy Pattern. Like applying some sort of policy to the behavior of the software system.


Example - Shipping cost calculator
